    <h1>WHAT IS THE TRUE PRICE WE PAY FOR OUR CLOTHES?</h1>
    <p>The fashion industry is the second-most polluting in the world, responsible for 10% of global pollution. Apparel workers are some of the lowest paid, overworked laborers. If the industry continues unchecked, it will use up all of the Earth's fresh water by 2050. This is what drove us to start really thinking about our clothing purchasing decisions and the impact they had on our environment, people, and our future. </p>

    <h1>HOW DO WE DRIVE RAPID CHANGE?</h1>
    <p>We wanted to figure out how to balance our consumer needs with our inner activist. Let's face it, it's difficult to pay sometimes double the price for an ethically-made piece of clothing and it is difficult to discover new brands that fit our style, but it doesn't have to be that way anymore! Through our partnerships with some of the most sustainable brands, we can offer you clothes that fit your price range, style, and help the environment- it's a win-win!</p>

    <h1>MISSION</h1>
